The /sys directory is generally where the sysfs filestystem is mounted, which contains information about devices and other kernel information.

The files in /sys/block contain information about block devices on your system. Your local system has a block device named sda, so /sys/block/sda exists. Your Amazon instance has a device named xvda, so /sys/block/xvda exists.

The /sys/block/<dev>/stat file provides several statistics about the state of block device <dev>. It consists of a single line of text containing 11 decimal values separated by whitespace:


cat /sys/class/block/sda1/stat
